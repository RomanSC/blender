    For my 3D modeling final I decided to model a full chess set. With time
saving techniques demonstrated by using the screw modifier tool, convert to mesh,
edit mode, and a few others, I was able to model the complete set of pieces I
hope to later print. The group of objects I have created can also be used to
render images like Figure 1.

    The most time consuming part of the process was making the individual pieces
themselves. Pieces like the pawn, rook, and queen were the easiest as they are
symmetrical.  Others such as the knight, bishop, and king were more difficult.
Knight being the least symmetrical of all of the shapes.

    To make each piece I started by changing the viewing mode to ortho linear
(numpad 5). I then selected the background image within the 3D view pane of the
Blender window. Making sure that the piece I was about to model was centered to
the grid. I used the Blender add-on "Add Mesh: Extra Objects" to create single
vertices in object mode, tracing around the symmetrical parts of the chess piece.
For the pawn it's the entire object.  For the knight it's only the pedestal that
the horse sits on.  After tracing one side of the chess piece by adding a single
vertex then extruding vertices all the way down I change to object mode and apply
the screw modifier from the modifier properties tab. (Right pane) after applying
the screw modifier I clicked on the object button at the bottom of 3d view,
selected convert to, and mesh from curve. Which creates a 3D mesh from the object
made by using the screw tool. In edit mode I check the bottom and top of the
model for holes.

    For the asymmetrical portions of each chess piece instead of starting with
single vertices when tracing I started with a cylinder making sure that it is
centered along the x and y axis. I switch back into ortho linear view mode and
begin extruding the cylinder up scaling each extrusion to the outline of my
reference image.

    After the cylinder matches the height and width tracing my reference I scaled
the each extrusion along the y axis so that it begins to look like a 3D version
of my reference. A horse head for the knight chess piece for example. For the
horse I using the decimate modifier and pulled out two vertices to form the ears.
I spun the model around on the z axis pulling in and pushing out individual
vertices while repairing holes in the model until it took the shape of a horse.

    For the top of the bishop it was a similar process of extruding a cylinder
upwards. Only I created an object out of the circle to make the cutout at the top
of the piece. I then positioned it and used the boolean modifier to make a cutout
in the shape. For all the circle tops in my models I deleted the circles I had
traced and replaced them with uv spheres in edit mode to make the circles more
perfect.

    To make the chess board I created a cube and scaled it down on the z axis to
25% of it's height. I then applied a material and wood texture to it. I
duplicated it moving the copy up on the y axis, changing the material color then
duplicate those piece in the x axis, then joined my 4 objects. Using the array
modifier I created 4 copies in the y direction applied it, and used one more
array modifier to make 4 copies in the x direction.  Completing my 8 by 8
chessboard. I included some screenshots of the process and a final render of my
chess pieces set up on the board.

    I hope to someday print the pieces after resizing the bases and tops to fit
standards of regulated chess pieces. I may even consider coming up with a way
to print a chessboard like the Adafruit one to go along with my pieces.
